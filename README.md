Go to https://github.com/ammargitham/WallFlow for all of the cool release info.  This is just my version.

I was about to build an app from scratch, but then I found WallFlow.  It does almost everything I wanted, but I wanted a few custom features.

Planned features:

-Support for foldables (Can't change main screen wallpaper when phone is closed)

-Tasker plugin integration???

-Ability to delete local wallpapers when you're tired of them.

-More constraints on auto wallpaper

-Reduced time limit for changing local wallpaper.
